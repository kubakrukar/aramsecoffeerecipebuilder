# Ārāmse receipe builder 

A web app implementation of Ārāmse's system for writing down coffee brewing recipes. There's a youtube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbJ7KlW24kU).

The app can be downloaded and run locally (you will need to install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)), or in the web browser via [this R Shiny app](http://krukar.eu/aramse).

Thanks to Ārāmse for a great idea and beautiful design.
